### Abstract

The [OSGi Alliance](https://www.osgi.org/) is holding its next Face to Face technical meeting in Darmstadt in late June
and we are pleased to have arranged an _Evening of OSGi_ with the [Darmstadt Java User Group](http://jug-da.de), [IoT
Hessen](http://www.meetup.com/IoT-Hessen/) and [Deutsche Telekom](http://www.telekom.de) /
[Qivicon](https://www.qivicon.com)’s support. We hope you can join us.

The evening will assume no prior knowledge of OSGi, however if you already have some experience  or are hardened OSGi
developer then you are also very welcome and it will be a great opportunity to meet with some of the people involved in
creating the specifications and reference implementations, and you will be able to dig a lot deeper in to the technology
one-on-one with them.

We have a packed agenda to give you an insight and overview into OSGi and some of its activities both in IoT and
Enterprise, along with an introduction to OSGi enRoute, which is relatively new initiative from the OSGi Alliance to
provide a quick start to OSGi for developers who have never used it before.

Attending and presenting will be:

* BJ Hargrave (OSGi Alliance CTO and Core Platform Expert Group Chair)
* David Bosschaert & Raymond Augé (OSGi Enterprise Expert Group Co-Chairs)
* Seven Ganlu & Tim Ward (OSGi IoT Expert Group Co-Chairs)
* Peter Kriens (OSGi Alliance Evangelist)

* 18:45 - 19:10: Introduction to OSGi. Including who the OSGi Alliance is, what we offer and a high level technical

and specification (BJ Hargrave).
* 19:10 - 19:30: Introduction to the Enterprise Expert Group. A brief history of what it offers and an insight in to
upcoming activities and specifications	(Raymond Auge & David Bosschaert).

* 19:50 - 20:30: OSGi enRoute - Quick start for developers ([http://enroute.osgi.org](http://enroute.osgi.org)). OSGi
enRoute is an open source project sponsored by OSGi to significantly simplify the development of OSGi Applications and
help developers get started with OSGi quickly. It is based on the OSGi R6 specifications and Java 8 but adds important
missing pieces to build actual applications for a wide range of areas, including web apps and IoT. Additionally, it
comes out of the box with a Maven, Gradle, bndtools, source version control, and CI based tool chain (Peter Kriens).
