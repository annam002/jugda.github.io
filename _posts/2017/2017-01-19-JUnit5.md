## JUnit 5 - Next Generation Testing on the JVM

### Abstract

Java's most ubiquitous library is getting an update! And this is the time to see what's new and weigh in on its course.

This talk will...

- show you how to write tests with JUnit 5
- walk you through the changes compared to JUnit 4
- present the new architecture
- discuss compatibility with previous JUnit versions, IDEs, and other testing tools

Be careful, though:  
You might end up with an urge to start using it right away.
