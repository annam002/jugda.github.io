### Meet the Experts

Das Spring Data Team trifft sich in Frankfurt und kommt dann am Abend zu uns nach Darmstadt. Nach dem Vortrag gibt es noch eine Diskussionsrunde zur Zukunft des Spring Data Projekts.

### Zusammenfassung

More and more projects are taking advantage of reactive programming. A key discovery is that the entire stack must be reactive. Reactive Relational Database Connectivity (R2DBC) is the new standard that brings full reactive support to SQL-based database systems. Discover why R2DBC is becoming the Java community's favorite mechanism for merging the most popular database engines with functional, reactive applications.
