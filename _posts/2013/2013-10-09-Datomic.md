### Abstract
Traditional SQL databases have great power, via ACID transactions and via a declarative, logic-based query language (SQL). But SQL databases encounter problems on the web:

- SQL databases have a rigid information model, and typically a rigid deployment model. This rigidity creates impedance mismatches both with development languages and with emerging cloud strategies.

- SQL databases are update-in-place, and forget the history of your data.

- SQL databases struggle with the extremely high write and/or data volumes that characterize the largest four percent of databases.
Much of the effort of the NoSQL movement has gone to solve the third problem, the problem of the four percent, under the mantra “web scale”. Datomic solves the first two problems — with a flexible information model and a deployment model suited to the dynamic web, and to the cloud.

Datomic is for the ninety-six percent.
