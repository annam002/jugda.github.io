Both talks are planned for ca. 40 minutes each and we will have a 5 minute break to rearrange the stage.

### Refactoring To Java 10

A sneak peek at the features that will (likely) be in Java 10. For each feature, we'll explain what it's trying to accomplish, what it'll probably look like (with code examples!), and how you can already prepare your source code so that you'll be ready once these features are released. For a few of these, we'll show you how Project Lombok can bring the future to you, today!

### Introducing a Hybrid Architecture in a Large Java Monolith

A case study at TOPdesk: how we went from two releases per year to one release per day for our monolith and multiple releases per day for our microservices. We will touch on the cultural and technical challenges of introducing our hybrid architecture which enables our monolith and microservices to live side-by-side.
