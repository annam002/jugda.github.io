### Zusammenfassung

Use a production-like, portable test environment described in code - gone is the need for heavyweight manual setup of test systems and the pain of sharing test infrastructure with multiple developers and teams. Launch a fully functional testing suite not only consisting of unit tests, but also of integration tests, right from source control. And instead of manually writing and maintaining a bunch of brittle bash scripts for instrumenting your containers, attendees will learn to leverage existing knowledge in writing JUnit tests and make use of the powerful TestContainers Java library.
Going one step further, the talk will also introduce Groovy and Spock as a substitute for JUnit, allowing to write easily readable and expressive BDD style tests.


### Sprecher

{% include speakerpic-name.html %} Java developer and JVM fanboy since being introduced to the language back in school 12 years ago. Founded his own company during his university years, developing mobile apps and client-server applications, which lead to his discovery of Grails and the Groovy ecosystem. Fell in love with TDD because of Spock.
Nowadays Kevin is working at the cyber security company GDATA and focuses on topics such as software craftsmanship, infrastructure as code and continuous integration pipelines, trying to make the world a better place one container at a time.
