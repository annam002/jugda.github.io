### Zusammenfassung

In this session, Tanja and Ivar will go through the upcoming Jakarta EE 9 release, how it lowers the barriers of entry, eases the migration, and lays the foundation for a platform for future innovation.

They will also look ahead towards what future releases may bring, as well as showing demos of how to convert from the `javax.*` to `jakarta.*` namespace and showcase available implementations and tooling support available.
